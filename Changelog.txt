v04
- Included a second shutter for 2 laser control
- new "Laser" menu for choosing the laser for illumination
- pinConfiguration altered due to new PCB layout
- illumination time can now be set to 100ms precision
- illumination time maximum is now 9min 59.9s

v03
- new Method for repeatability measurements
	- rep[amount of different angles],[motorApproach 1st angle],[amount of tests at 1st angle],[first angle],
      	  [motorApproach 2nd angle],[amount of tests 2nd angle],[second angle],...,
          [motorApproach nth angle],[amount of tests last angle],[last angle],\n
	- first referencing is removed for repeatability measurements

v02
- Changed Stage to Meos rotational Stage
    - Gears included (120:1)
    - Reference switch in Stage
- Start-up is now doing a reference move. 
- No Referencing before illumination (option available)
- New !Reference" menu
    - false: not referencing before illumination
    - true: referencing before illumination
    - start reference available
- new "Motor" menu
    - Menu is only for alignment
    - turn right fast
    - turn right slow
    - turn left fast
    - turn left slow
- new Referencing algorithm
    - Turn stage cw fast till switch activates
    - Turn stage ccw for 5Â°
    - Turn stage cw slow till switch activates again, save as pos1
    - Turn stage cw fast till switch deactivates
    - Turn stage ccw slwo till switch activates, save as pos2
    - Move to zero position (middle of pos1 and pos2)
